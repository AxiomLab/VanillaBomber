# Minecraft Vanilla Server Bomber (shortly MVSB)

# DISCLAIMER
** DO not use this tool against the Minecraft EULA (End User License Agreement), this tool is created to everyone for taking down servers that breaks EULA and neonazis-servers **

## Why?
In recent times I notice more and more neo-Nazi, violating EULA servers in the game of Minecraft, so I decided to develop a powerful program that takes down these servers that no one can access them.

## How does it work?
The program is built on packages such as Mineflayer and Electron for Node.JS, with the help of Mineflayer, bots fill the server until the server stops accepting players and then the bots start spamming to load and shut down the server.
Bots are making an new account with a new username if its banned, also bot rejoins on every timeout
